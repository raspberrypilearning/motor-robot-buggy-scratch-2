This is a **Scratch 2** project. There are more up to date projects for **Scratch3** that require a **Raspberry Pi 4**.

For earlier models of Raspberry Pi you may also want to look at [physical computing for Scratch 1.4 project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing-with-scratch14){:target="_blank"} where you can learn about programming LEDs, buzzers and button switches, and a [Python robot buggy project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy){:target="_blank"}.

## Introduction

In this project you will learn how to wire and control button motors as electronic outputs using a simple motor controller and a Raspberry Pi running Scratch 2. 
You will make a few different projects using motors, including a robot buggy, and write different Scratch programs to control your robot buggy in different ways.

### Hardware

+ A Raspberry Pi
+ A motor controller, such a the [CamJam EduKit 3 motor controller](https://thepihut.com/products/camjam-edukit-motor-controller){:target="_blank"}
+ 2 [gear motors](https://thepihut.com/products/adafruit-dc-gearbox-motor-tt-motor-200rpm-3-to-6vdc-ada3777){:target="_blank"}
+ 2 [wheels](https://thepihut.com/products/adafruit-black-multi-hub-wheel-for-tt-lego-or-n20-motor-65mm-diameter-ada4205){:target="_blank"} for the gear motors
+ A [roller ball castor](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pololu-ball-caster-with-3-4-metal-ball?variant=390424422){:target="_blank"} or just someting smooth such as a table tennis ball
+ A 4x AA battery box with on/off switch
+ Materials to make you robot buggy chassis

**Note:** Many low cost gear motors are available without wires already attached. These will work fine but unless you are going to solder wires on yourself, connecting to the motor controller is much trickier than motors that come with wires attached.
If you do wish to solder wires onto gear motors, you will find help on how to do so in the [Python build a robot buggy project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy/2){:target="_blank"}.
There are also kits available that contain all the robot components you will need such as the [CamJam EduKit 3 Robotics kit](https://thepihut.com/products/camjam-edukit-3-robotics){:target="_blank"}.

### Software

+ Scratch 2 - if not already installed, open a terminal and type:

```bash
sudo apt install scratch2
```

Or go to main **Raspberry Pi menu** > **Preferences** > **Recommended Software**, and check the **Scratch 2** install box.
